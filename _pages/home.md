FEAST is a JWST Cycle 1 program (GO 1783, PI Adamo) aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of star formation and stellar feedback across diverse galactic environments.

Much of our knowledge of stellar feedback comes from detailed studies of nearby star-forming regions within the Milky Way. FEAST breaks new ground by targeting **extragalactic systems**, enabling a more complete and representative picture of star formation in the Local Universe. The FEAST targets are drawn from the well-studied Local Volume Legacy (LVL) survey, which targets galaxies within 11 Mpc. Our galaxy sample (NGC628, M83, M51, NGC4449 and NGC4485/NGC4490) includes a remarkable range of environments: from nuclear starburts and molecular rings, to interacting galaxies, as well as low-pressure dwarf systems and diverse spiral arm morphologies.

What sets FEAST apart is its unparalleled **multi-wavelength coverage**, combining data from HST, MUSE, ALMA, as well as new JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging (GO 1783) imaging and NIRSpec multiplex spectroscopy (GO 3503), at previously unreachable spatial resolutions (on the scale of **parsecs**).

### Scientific Objectives

FEAST is designed to address fundamental questions about how young star clusters (the building blocks of galaxies) interact with their surroundings, and how subsequent stellar feedbacl processes regulate galaxy evolution.

Specifically, FEAST's goals are:
